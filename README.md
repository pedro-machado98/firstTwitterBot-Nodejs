#First Twitter Bot - Nodejs

This is my first attempt to build and deploy a twitter bot after i initiated studying node.js in IBM Skills Network.

The stack i used was firebase and node.js.
The core idea of this bot was to be able to request the tokens with node.js from the twitter API v2, keep that key on the firebase and use that to every request i made.
With the token of twitter in hands i also got the OpenAi token to make a request there first and than tweet the response of that request do the OpenAi.

My next goal is to delete the OpenAi request and make a for loop that will increment one day at the time and calculate how much is left to end the college period of that semester.

To guide me i used a YouTube Video and i will attach the link bellow:
